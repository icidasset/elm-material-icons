# Icons Generator

This ruby and javascript code is used to generate the Elm code for the icons. Definitely not the most performant or efficient code, but it works. Just wanted to put something together quickly. Shouldn't be used much anyways, maybe once every 3 months, if not less.

```shell
# see .tool-versions file for which versions I used for nodejs and ruby.
pnpm install
bundle
ruby generate.rb
```
